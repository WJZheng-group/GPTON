9111037.0,"Interaction of HIV-1 Tat protein with heparin. Role of the backbone structure, sulfation, and size.. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein is released from infected cells. Extracellular Tat enters the cell where it stimulates the transcriptional activity of HIV-long terminal repeat (LTR) and of endogenous genes. Heparin modulates the angiogenic (Albini, A., Benelli, R., Presta, M., Rusnati, M., Ziche, M., Rubartelli, A., Paglialunga, G., Bussolino, F., and Noonan, D. (1996) Oncogene 12, 289-297) and transcriptional (Mann, D. A., and Frankel, A. D. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1733-1739) activity of extracellular Tat. Here we demonstrate that heparin binds specifically to recombinant HIV-1 Tat produced as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS), but not dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates A and C, hyaluronic acid, and K5 polysaccharide, competed with 3H-labeled heparin for binding to immobilized GST-Tat and inhibited HIV-LTR transactivation induced by extracellular GST-Tat. Selective 2-O-, 6-O-, total-O-desulfation, or N-desulfation/N-acetylation dramatically reduced the capacity of heparin to bind GST-Tat. Totally-O-desulfated and 2-O-desulfated heparins also showed a reduced capacity to inhibit the transactivating activity of GST-Tat. Very low molecular weight heparins showed a significant decrease in their capacity to bind GST-Tat and to inhibit its LTR transactivating activity when compared with conventional 13.6-kDa heparin. However, when 3.0-kDa heparin was affinity chromatographed on immobilized GST-Tat to isolate binding and non-binding subfractions, the Tat-bound fraction was >/=1,000 times more potent than the unbound fraction in inhibiting the transactivating activity of GST-Tat. The results demonstrate that Tat interacts in a size-dependent manner with heparin/HS and that high affinity Tat-heparin interaction requires at least some 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-positions to be sulfated. The Tat binding activity of the glycosaminoglycans tested correlates with their capacity to affect the transactivating activity of extracellular Tat, indicating the possibility to design specific heparin/HS-like structures with Tat-antagonist activity."
9792716.0,"Multiple heparan sulfate chains are required for optimal syndecan-1 function.. Syndecans have three highly conserved sites available for heparan sulfate attachment. To determine if all three sites are required for normal function, a series of mutated syndecans having two, one, or no heparan sulfate chains were expressed in ARH-77 cells. Previously, we demonstrated that expression of wild-type syndecan-1 on these myeloma cells mediates cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion and inhibits cell invasion into collagen gels. Here we show that to optimally mediate each of these activities, all three sites of heparan sulfate attachment are required. Generally, an increasing loss of syndecan-1 function occurs as the number of heparan sulfate attachment sites decreases. This loss of function is not the result of a decrease in either the total amount of cell surface heparan sulfate or syndecan-1 core protein. In regard to cell invasion, cells expressing syndecan-1 bearing a single heparan sulfate attachment site exhibit a hierarchy of function based upon the position of the site within the core protein; the presence of an available attachment site at serine 47 confers the greatest level of activity, while serine 37 contributes little to syndecan-1 function. However, when all three heparan sulfate chains are present, significantly greater biological activity is observed than is predicted by the sum of the activities occurring when the chains act individually. This synergy provides a functional basis for the evolutionary conservation of the three heparan sulfate attachment sites on syndecans and supports the idea that molecular heterogeneity, which is characteristic of proteoglycans, contributes to their functional diversity."
12902511.0,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 supports IL-8-mediated neutrophil transendothelial migration by inhibition of the constitutive shedding of endothelial IL-8/heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes.. The endothelium is the primary barrier to leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation. Neutrophil recruitment is directed by transendothelial gradients of IL-8 that, in vivo, are bound to the endothelial cell surface. We have investigated the identity and function of the binding site(s) in an in vitro model of neutrophil transendothelial migration. In endothelial culture supernatants, IL-8 was detected in a trimolecular complex with heparan sulfate and syndecan-1. Constitutive shedding of IL-8 in this form was increased in the presence of a neutralizing Ab to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), indicating a role for endothelial plasminogen activator in the shedding of IL-8. Increased shedding of IL-8/heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes was accompanied by inhibition of neutrophil transendothelial migration, and aprotinin, a potent plasmin inhibitor, reversed this inhibition. Platelets, added as an exogenous source of PAI-1, had no effect on shedding of the complexes or neutrophil migration. Our results indicate that IL-8 is immobilized on the endothelial cell surface through binding to syndecan-1 ectodomains, and that plasmin, generated by endothelial plasminogen activator, induces the shedding of this form of IL-8. PAI-1 appears to stabilize the chemoattractant form of IL-8 at the cell surface and may represent a therapeutic target for novel anti-inflammatory strategies."
12975379.0,"Syndecan-1 transmembrane and extracellular domains have unique and distinct roles in cell spreading.. Raji cells expressing syndecan-1 (Raji-S1) adhere and spread when plated on heparan sulfate-binding extracellular matrix ligands or monoclonal antibody 281.2, an antibody directed against the syndecan-1 extracellular domain. Cells plated on monoclonal antibody 281.2 initially extend a broad lamellipodium, a response accompanied by membrane ruffling at the cell margin. Membrane ruffling then becomes polarized, leading to an elongated cell morphology. Previous work demonstrated that the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain is not required for these activities, suggesting important roles for the syndecan-1 transmembrane and/or extracellular domains in the assembly of a signaling complex necessary for spreading. Work described here demonstrates that truncation of the syndecan-1 extracellular domain does not affect the initial lamellipodial extension in the Raji-S1 cells but does inhibit the active membrane ruffling that is necessary for cell polarization. Replacement of the entire syndecan-1 transmembrane domain with leucine residues completely blocks the cell spreading. These data demonstrate that the syndecan-1 transmembrane and extracellular domains have important but distinct roles in Raji-S1 cell spreading; the extracellular domain mediates an interaction that is necessary for dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements whereas an interaction of the transmembrane domain is required for the initial spreading response."

15728209.0,"Syndecan-1 is involved in osteoprotegerin-induced chemotaxis in human peripheral blood monocytes.. Chronic inflammation is characterized by tissue infiltration with monocytes/macrophages, which possess broad proinflammatory, destructive, and remodeling capacities. Elevated levels of osteoprotegerin, an important regulator of differentiation and activation of osteoclasts that also affects different cells of the immune system, were found in the serum of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. The study of whether osteoprotegerin affects monocyte locomotion in vitro and the possible mechanisms and pathways involved was investigated using Boyden microchemotaxis chambers and Western blot analyses. Osteoprotegerin significantly stimulated monocyte chemotaxis, whereas preincubation of monocytes with osteoprotegerin inhibited monocyte migration toward optimal concentrations of regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted, monocyte chemotactic protein -1, and procalcitonin. The effects of osteoprotegerin were abolished by pretreating cells with heparinase I and chondroitinase or antibodies against the ectodomain of syndecan-1. Osteoprotegerin signaling was shown to involve protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and tyrosine kinase. Data suggest that osteoprotegerin affects monocyte mi-gration and protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation via syndecan-1. Osteoprotegerin-induced deactivation of monocyte chemotaxis toward different chemokines is due to interaction of osteoprotegerin with heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate."
18179784.0,"MEGF10 association with schizophrenia.. The 5q21-31 region has been implicated as harboring risk genes for schizophrenia in many linkage studies. In our previous report of stepwise fine mapping of this region, the MEGF10 gene was one of the genes showing consistent associations in our screening subsample. In this study, we carried out independent replication and expression studies of the MEGF10 gene."
18182846.0,"Overexpression of SOX15 inhibits proliferation of NT2/D1 cells derived from a testicular embryonal cell carcinoma.. SOX (Sry-related HMG box) family proteins, which have an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain, have crucial roles in cell differentiation. However, their target genes remain enigmatic. Some members of the SOX family may have roles in regulation of cell proliferation. We established stable NT2/D1 cell lines overexpressing SOX15 (SOX15-NT2/D1), and a modified 3-(4,5-dime-thylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that the SOX15-NT2/D1 cells exhibited significantly slower growth than the controls. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that an increased fraction of the SOX15-NT2/D1 cells were in G1-G0. In addition, a microarray analysis identified 26 genes that were up-regulated in the SOX15-NT2/D1 cells, but none that were down-regulated genes. Among the up-regulated genes, IGFBP5, S100A4, ID2, FABP5, MTSS1, PDCD4 have been shown to be related to cell proliferation and/or the cell cycle."
18378436.0,"Adhesion and protease activity in cell lines from human salivary gland tumors are regulated by the laminin-derived peptide AG73, syndecan-1 and beta1 integrin.. We studied the induction of protease activity by the laminin alpha1-derived peptide AG73 in cells from adenoid cystic carcinoma (CAC2) and myoepithelioma (M1), respectively a malignant and a benign salivary gland tumors. Laminin alpha1 chain and MMP9 were immunolocalized in adenoid cystic carcinoma and myoepithelioma in vivo and in vitro. Cells grown inside AG73-enriched laminin-111 exhibited large spaces in the extracellular matrix, suggestive of remodeling. The broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 decreased spaces induced by AG73 in CAC2 and M1 cells. This result strongly suggests that AG73-mediated matrix remodeling involves matrix metalloproteinases. CAC2 and M1 cells cultured on AG73 showed a dose-dependent increase of MMP9 secretion, as detected by zymography. Furthermore, siRNA silencing of MMP9 decreased remodeling in 3D cultures. We searched for AG73 receptors regulating MMP9 activity in our cell lines. CAC2 and M1 cells grown on AG73 exhibited colocalization of syndecan-1 and beta1 integrin. siRNA knockdown of syndecan-1 expression in these cells resulted in decreased adhesion to AG73 and reduced protease and remodeling activity. We investigated syndecan-1 co-receptors in both cell lines. Silencing beta1 integrin inhibited adhesion to AG73, matrix remodeling and protease activity. Double-knockdown experiments were carried out to further explore syndecan-1 and beta1 integrin cooperation. CAC2 cells transfected with both syndecan-1 and beta1 integrin siRNA oligos showed significant decrease in adhesion to AG73. Simultaneous silencing of receptors also induced a decrease in protease activity. Our results suggest that syndecan-1 and beta1 integrin signaling downstream of AG73 regulate adhesion and MMP production by CAC2 and M1 cells."
20181947.0,"Interaction of syndecan and alpha6beta4 integrin cytoplasmic domains: regulation of ErbB2-mediated integrin activation.. The alpha6beta4 integrin is a laminin 332 (LN332) receptor central to the formation of hemidesmosomes in epithelial layers. However, the integrin becomes phosphorylated by keratinocytes responding to epidermal growth factor in skin wounds or by squamous cell carcinomas that overexpress/hyperactivate the tyrosine kinase ErbB2, epidermal growth factor receptor, or c-Met. We show here that the beta4-dependent signaling in A431 human squamous carcinoma cells is dependent on the syndecan family of matrix receptors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis identifies an interaction within the distal third (amino acids 1473-1752) of the beta4 cytoplasmic domain and the conserved C2 region of the syndecan cytoplasmic domain. Via its C2 region, Sdc1 forms a complex with the alpha6beta4 integrin along with the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 and the cytoplasmic kinase Fyn in A431 cells. Engagement of LN332 or clustering of the alpha6beta4 integrin with integrin-specific antibodies causes phosphorylation of ErbB2, Fyn, and the beta4 subunit as well as activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt and their assimilation into this complex. This leads to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent cell spreading and Akt-dependent protection from apoptosis. This is disrupted by RNA interference silencing of Sdc1 but can be rescued by mouse Sdc1 or Sdc4 but not by syndecan mutants lacking their C-terminal C2 region. This disruption does not prevent the phosphorylation of ErbB2 or Fyn but blocks the Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of the beta4 tail. We propose that syndecans engage the distal region of the beta4 cytoplasmic domain and bring it to the plasma membrane, where it can be acted upon by Src family kinases."
20477813.0,"The prognostic value of intraepithelial and stromal CD3-, CD117- and CD138-positive cells in non-small cell lung carcinoma.. The major value of prognostic markers in potentially curable non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) should be to guide therapy after surgical treatment. Although tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes and plasma cells have been documented in NSCLC, a clear association with clinical outcome, especially for the stromal component, has not been well established. The aim of this study was to elucidate the prognostic significance of these cells/markers in the epithelial and stromal compartments of NSCLC. Tissue microarrays from 335 resected, stage I-IIIA, NSCLC were constructed by duplicate cores from viable neoplastic epithelial and stromal areas. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the infiltration of CD3(+), CD117(+) as well as CD138(+) cells in epithelial and stromal areas. In univariate analyses, increasing numbers of stromal CD3(+) (p = 0.001) and epithelial CD3(+) cells (p = 0.004) correlated significantly with an improved disease-specific survival. No such relation was noted with CD3(+) or CD117(+) cells. In the multivariate analysis, stromal CD3(+) cells was an independent prognostic factor for disease-specific survival (HR 1.925, CI 1.21-3.04, p = 0.005). Increased presence of the pan T-cell marker, CD3, which is an independent factor, correlates with improved clinical outcome in NSCLC. This prognostic impact of T cells is clearer in the tumor stroma. Neither plasma cells nor mast cells were prognostic indicators in our cohort."
24956062.0,"Cell communication using intrinsically disordered proteins: what can syndecans say?. Because intrinsically disordered proteins are incapable of forming unique tertiary structures in isolation, their interaction with partner structures enables them to play important roles in many different biological functions. Therefore, such proteins are usually multifunctional, and their ability to perform their major function, as well as accessory functions, depends on the characteristics of a given interaction. The present paper demonstrates, using predictions from two programs, that the transmembrane proteoglycans syndecans are natively disordered because of their diverse functions and large number of interaction partners. Syndecans perform multiple functions during development, damage repair, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis. By mediating the binding of a large number of extracellular ligands to their receptors, these proteoglycans trigger a cascade of reactions that subsequently regulate various cell processes: cytoskeleton formation, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. The occurrences of 20 amino acids in syndecans 1-4 from 25 animals were compared with those in 17 animal proteomes. Gly + Ala, Thr, Glu, and Pro were observed to predominate in the syndecans, contributing to the lack of an ordered structure. In contrast, there were many fewer amino acids in syndecans that promote an ordered structure, such as Cys, Trp, Asn, and His. In addition, a region rich in Asp has been identified between two heparan sulfate-binding sites in the ectodomains, and a region rich in Lys has been identified in the conserved C1 site of the cytoplasmic domain. These particular regions play an essential role in the various functions of syndecans due to their lack of structure. "
25017879.0,"Midkine and syndecan‑1 levels correlate with the progression of malignant gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma.. The present study aimed to determine whether the expression levels of midkine (MK) and syndecan‑1 correlate with the malignant progression and poor prognosis of gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA). GCA tissue samples (n=72) were obtained from the Department of Pathology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology (Luoyang, China). The paraffin‑embedded samples had been surgically resected and pathologically diagnosed between 2007 and 2009. Normal gastric cardiac biopsy specimens (n=40) were also collected as the control. The expression levels of MK and syndecan‑1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry using the high‑sensitivity streptavidin‑peroxidase method. Statistical analysis was performed on the data obtained using the SPSS 17.0 statistics package. MK expression was detected in 76.4% of GCA samples and 5% of normal gastric cardiac mucosa specimens. A significant positive correlation was observed between the expression levels of MK and the infiltrative depth of the tumor, the presence of lymph node metastasis and the prognosis of the patients (P<0.05). Syndecan‑1 expression was detected in 38.9% of GCA samples and 100% of normal gastric cardiac mucosa samples. The expression levels of syndecan‑1 were negatively correlated with the grade of differentiation, serosal membrane invasion, lymph node metastasis and the patient's prognosis (P<0.05). Notably, the expression levels of MK and syndecan‑1 were inversely correlated (r=‑0.352, P<0.01) in the GCA tissue samples. These results suggest that high expression levels of MK in GCA tissues may indicate a differentiation stage that is characteristic of malignancy, a late clinical stage and a poor prognosis, whereas increased syndecan‑1 levels may indicate a high degree of differentiation, an early clinical stage and a favorable prognosis. MK and syndecan‑1 may serve as important biomarkers for monitoring the development and progression of GCA."
25236603.0,"Loss of cell invasiveness through PKC-mediated syndecan-1 downregulation in melanoma cells under anchorage independency.. Anchorage-independent survival is one of the key features for malignant tumor cells. Whether specific gene alterations contributed by anchorage independency would further affect metastatic phenotypes of melanoma cells was unclear. We adapted suspension culture of melanoma cells to establish anchorage independency. The suspended melanoma cells lost their invasive abilities in vitro. Specific loss of laminin-binding ability in suspended melanoma cells was observed, which was correlated with downregulation of syndecan-1 as revealed by microarray and validated by qPCR and Western blot. Modulation of syndecan-1 expression level affected laminin binding, transwell migration and matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion in melanoma cells. SDC1 expression and transwell migration were correlated with activity or level of protein kinase Cδ as evidence by specific inhibitors and shRNA transfection. In this study, we compared metastatic phenotypes and gene expressions of adherent and suspended melanoma cells. The anchorage independency led to protein kinase Cδ-mediated syndecan-1 downregulation, which contributed to loss of laminin-binding ability, reduced metalloproteinase-2 secretion and loss of invasiveness.

25274915.0,"The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and Syndecan-4 in cartilage from osteoarthritic knees.. Previous studies support the important role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and syndecan-4 in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Both VEGF and syndecan-4 are expressed by chondrocytes and both are involved in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-3, resulting in the activation of aggrecanase II (ADAMTS-5), which is essential in the pathogenesis of OA. However, the relationship between VEGF and syndecan-4 has not been established. As a pilot study, we assayed the expression of VEGF and syndecan-4 in cartilage samples and cultured chondrocytes from osteoarthritic knee joints and analysed the relationship between these two factors. Specimens were collected from 21 female patients (29 knees) who underwent total knee replacement due to severe medial OA of the knee (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4). Articular cartilage samples, obtained from bone and cartilage excised during surgery, were analysed and used for chondrocyte culture. We found that the levels of expression of VEGF and syndecan-4 mRNA did not differ significantly between medial femoral cartilage with severe degenerative changes and lateral femoral cartilage that appeared grossly normal (p = 0.443 and 0.622, respectively). Likewise, the levels of expression of VEGF and syndecan-4 mRNA were similar in cultured chondrocytes from medial and lateral femoral cartilage. The levels of expression of VEGF and syndecan-4 mRNAs were significantly and positively correlated in cartilage explant (r = 0.601, p = 0.003) but not in cultured chondrocytes. These results suggest that there is a close relationship between VEGF and syndecan-4 in the cartilage of patients with OA. Further studies are needed to determine the exact pathway by which these two factors interact in the pathogenesis of OA."
27758044.0,"Heparanase regulation of cancer, autophagy and inflammation: new mechanisms and targets for therapy.. Because of its impact on multiple biological pathways, heparanase has emerged as a major regulator of cancer, inflammation and other disease processes. Heparanase accomplishes this by degrading heparan sulfate which regulates the abundance and location of heparin-binding growth factors thereby influencing multiple signaling pathways that control gene expression, syndecan shedding and cell behavior. In addition, heparanase can act via nonenzymatic mechanisms that directly activate signaling at the cell surface. Clinical trials testing heparanase inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics are showing early signs of efficacy in patients further emphasizing the biological importance of this enzyme. This review focuses on recent developments in the field of heparanase regulation of cancer and inflammation, including the impact of heparanase on exosomes and autophagy, and novel mechanisms whereby heparanase regulates tumor metastasis, angiogenesis and chemoresistance. In addition, the ongoing development of heparanase inhibitors and their potential for treating cancer and inflammation are discussed."
32485953.0,"Syndecan-1 Facilitates the Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteo-Adipogenic Balance.. Bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stems cells (hMSCs) are precursors to adipocyte and osteoblast lineage cells. Dysregulation of the osteo-adipogenic balance has been implicated in pathological conditions involving bone loss. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) such as cell membrane-bound syndecans (SDCs) and glypicans (GPCs) mediate hMSC lineage differentiation and with syndecan-1 (SDC-1) reported in both adipogenesis and osteogenesis, these macromolecules are potential regulators of the osteo-adipogenic balance. Here, we disrupted the HSPG profile in primary hMSC cultures via temporal knockdown (KD) of SDC-1 using RNA interference (RNAi) in undifferentiated, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiated hMSCs. SDC-1 KD cultures were examined for osteogenic and adipogenic lineage markers along with changes in HSPG profile and common signalling pathways implicated in hMSC lineage fate. Undifferentiated hMSC SDC-1 KD cultures exhibited a pro-adipogenic phenotype with subsequent osteogenic differentiation demonstrating enhanced maturation of osteoblasts. In cultures where SDC-1 KD was performed following initiation of differentiation, increased adipogenic gene and protein marker expression along with increased Oil Red O staining identified enhanced adipogenesis, with impaired osteogenesis also observed in these cultures. These findings implicate SDC-1 as a facilitator of the hMSC osteo-adipogenic balance during early induction of lineage differentiation."
32814053.0,"Interactome Mapping Provides a Network of Neurodegenerative Disease Proteins and Uncovers Widespread Protein Aggregation in Affected Brains.. Interactome maps are valuable resources to elucidate protein function and disease mechanisms. Here, we report on an interactome map that focuses on neurodegenerative disease (ND), connects ∼5,000 human proteins via ∼30,000 candidate interactions and is generated by systematic yeast two-hybrid interaction screening of ∼500 ND-related proteins and integration of literature interactions. This network reveals interconnectivity across diseases and links many known ND-causing proteins, such as α-synuclein, TDP-43, and ATXN1, to a host of proteins previously unrelated to NDs. It facilitates the identification of interacting proteins that significantly influence mutant TDP-43 and HTT toxicity in transgenic flies, as well as of ARF-GEP100 that controls misfolding and aggregation of multiple ND-causing proteins in experimental model systems. Furthermore, it enables the prediction of ND-specific subnetworks and the identification of proteins, such as ATXN1 and MKL1, that are abnormally aggregated in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting widespread protein aggregation in NDs."
33595099.0,"Plasma concentrations of syndecan-1 are dependent on kidney function.. Elevated plasma concentrations of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate in studies of trauma, sepsis, and major surgery are commonly assumed to indicate acute glycocalyx degradation.

34400721.0,"Circulating syndecan-1 is reduced in pregnancies with poor fetal growth and its secretion regulated by matrix metalloproteinases and the mitochondria.. Fetal growth restriction is a leading cause of stillbirth that often remains undetected during pregnancy. Identifying novel biomarkers may improve detection of pregnancies at risk. This study aimed to assess syndecan-1 as a biomarker for small for gestational age (SGA) or fetal growth restricted (FGR) pregnancies and determine its molecular regulation. Circulating maternal syndecan-1 was measured in several cohorts; a large prospective cohort collected around 36 weeks' gestation (n = 1206), a case control study from the Manchester Antenatal Vascular service (285 women sampled at 24-34 weeks' gestation); two prospective cohorts collected on the day of delivery (36 + 3-41 + 3 weeks' gestation, n = 562 and n = 405 respectively) and a cohort who delivered for preterm FGR (< 34 weeks). Circulating syndecan-1 was consistently reduced in women destined to deliver growth restricted infants and those delivering for preterm disease. Syndecan-1 secretion was reduced by hypoxia, and its loss impaired proliferation. Matrix metalloproteinases and mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors significantly reduced syndecan-1 secretion, an effect that was rescued by coadministration of succinate, a mitochondrial electron transport chain activator. In conclusion, circulating syndecan-1 is reduced among cases of term and preterm growth restriction and has potential for inclusion in multi-marker algorithms to improve detection of poorly grown fetuses."
